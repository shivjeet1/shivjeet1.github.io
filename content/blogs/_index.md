## Welcome

These blogs are a collection of short posts, ideas, and insights from my programming journey.

Expect content on:

- Projects and experiments  
- Code tips and tricks  
- CI/CD and DevOps practices  
- Java, Linux, and development tools  

I write to document, reflect, and share â€” hoping it helps others along the way.
