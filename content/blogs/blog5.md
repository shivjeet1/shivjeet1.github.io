## Personal Opinion

>I’ve tried all these modules on my Redmi 12 5G, and I can honestly say the difference is night and day. FPS Booster made games feel smooth, NLXThermals kept the phone cool during long sessions, and ReVanced Extended completely changed my YouTube experience.
>Rooting and using Magisk can seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, it’s like unlocking a hidden layer of Android. My advice? Start slow, use Bootloop Protector, and experiment—it’s worth the effort!
