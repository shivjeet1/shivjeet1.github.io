## Introduction

Most Android phones come packed with **unnecessary preinstalled apps**, background services, and tracking components that slow down performance and drain battery.  
Even on clean-looking phones, there is always some hidden junk running silently.

In this blog, I’m listing **5 Android debloating and optimization tools** that actually help — without breaking your phone (if used properly).

These tools work on **both rooted and non-rooted devices**, though root obviously gives you more control.
