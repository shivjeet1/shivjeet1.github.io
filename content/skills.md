## Overview

This page highlights the **technical skills and tools** I’ve gained through hands-on projects, experimentation, and continuous learning.

My focus is on building practical systems, understanding how things work under the hood, and improving workflows through automation.

---

## Programming Languages

- **Java** – Core concepts, OOP, basic backend development  
- **Python** – Scripting, automation, tooling, Selenium  
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** – Frontend development, tooling, build systems  
- **Shell (Bash/Zsh)** – Linux automation and scripting  
- **SQL** – Basic querying and database interaction  

---

## Web & App Development

- **React** – Component-based UI development  
- **Vite** – Modern frontend tooling  
- **Tauri** – Desktop app development  
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – Responsive layouts and styling  
- **Android (Basic)** – Build system familiarity and debugging  

---

## DevOps & Tooling

- **Docker** – Containerization and reproducible environments  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control, workflows, CI integration  
- **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD pipelines and automation  
- **Linux** – Arch-based systems, system configuration  
- **Make / CMake** – Build tooling fundamentals  

---

## Operating Systems & Platforms

- **Arch Linux** – Daily driver, custom setups, scripting

## Security & Customization

- Android rooting (Magisk, LSPosed)  
- Custom ROM installation  
- Bootloader unlocking & recovery tools  
- Device optimization and debloating

I believe skills are best proven through **projects**, not lists.  
This page evolves as I build, break, and rebuild things.
