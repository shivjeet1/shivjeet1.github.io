## About me

- Just a tech-savvy CSE student having strong interests in Linux, DevOps, Cybersecurity and System Development.

- I explore through code. From hacking around with Linux installs to experimenting with AI-powered tools, I keep pushing into new areas just to see what I can build.

- My Tech journey began as I got my Android Phone *(Redmi Note 8)* back in 2019 *(Corona-Time)*. I got curious so learnt many things, bricked my device a few times as well, but I made sure that the performance is never *compromised*.
  >Check my [Blogs](/blogs/).

- I started rewriting code for fun — now I create tools that solve real problems, from building a database in C and simulating virtual machines to automating Linux installations and experimenting with GitHub Actions to build a Cross-Platform Application.
